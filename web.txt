How does the internet work?

When we enter a website name lets say "google.com" this is routed to your ISP
or internet service provider. Then this request is routed to a DNS or domain
name service. The DNS then send the IP address back to the ISP and then thats
sent back to the web browser. 

Now your browser uses that IP to go to the correct server (google's). and then
google server sends back the correct files from their server (html/css, javascript).
And now your browser has a completed webpage for you to explore. This all happens
in a mere seconds.
